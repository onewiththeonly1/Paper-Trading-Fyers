## 📊 Paper Trading Execution Logic

### BUY Orders
1. Fetches market depth from Fyers
2. Uses **best ASK price** (seller's offer)
3. Records trade at that price
4. Updates position immediately

### SELL Orders
1. Fetches market depth from Fyers
2. Uses **best BID price** (buyer's offer)
3. Records trade at that price
4. Matches with pending buys (FIFO)
5. Creates trade record with P&L

### Price Updates
* Continues to fetch real-time LTP
* Updates MTM P&L for open positions
* Same as real trading mode

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "FileNotFoundError: web/index.html"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify file structure
ls -la web/index.html
ls -la internal/trader.py

# Ensure all files are in correct locations
```

### Issue: Terminal not responding to keystrokes

**Cause:** IDE console doesn't support raw terminal mode.

**Solution:** Run from a proper terminal:
```bash
# From system terminal, not IDE console
cd ~/paper-trading-fyers
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### Issue: Paper trading shows wrong prices

**Cause:** Market depth fetch may have failed.

**Solution:** Check:
1. Valid access token
2. Symbol exists and is trading
3. Internet connection
4. Check `trading.log` for "[PAPER]" entries

### Issue: Trade history not showing

**Cause:** No completed round-trip trades yet.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've both bought AND sold
2. Check position is fully closed
3. Refresh dashboard

## 📊 Trade Analytics

### Analyzing Exported Data

After exporting trades to CSV, you can analyze:

1. **Win Rate** = (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100
2. **Average Win** = Sum of winning P&L / Winning trades
3. **Average Loss** = Sum of losing P&L / Losing trades
4. **Risk-Reward Ratio** = Average Win / Average Loss
5. **Profit Factor** = Gross Profit / Gross Loss
6. **Average Trade Duration** = Total duration / Total trades

### Excel/Google Sheets Formulas

```excel
# Win Rate
=COUNTIF(H:H,">0")/COUNTA(H:H)*100

# Average Win
=AVERAGEIF(H:H,">0")

# Average Loss
=AVERAGEIF(H:H,"<0")

# Profit Factor
=SUMIF(H:H,">0")/ABS(SUMIF(H:H,"<0"))
```
